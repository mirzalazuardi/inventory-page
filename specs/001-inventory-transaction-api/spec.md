# Feature Specification: Simple Inventory Transaction System

**Feature Branch**: `001-inventory-transaction-api`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a Simple Inventory System API with: Product (name:string, stock:integer), Transaction (product_id:integer, quantity:integer, transaction_type:string). POST /transactions: If type=\"in\" add quantity to product stock. If type=\"out\" subtract quantity but reject if stock < quantity. Success: 200 + { \"message\": \"Transaction created successfully\", \"product\": { id, name, stock } }. Error: 422 + { \"error\": \"Insufficient stock for product Apple\" }. GET /transactions: Returns paginated list (header pagination). Supports filtering by product_id (q[product_id_eq]). Supports sorting by quantity (q[s]=quantity desc). Full RSpec coverage required. No auth. JSON only."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Record Incoming Stock (Priority: P1)

A warehouse manager receives new inventory and needs to increase the stock count for a product. They submit a transaction recording the quantity received, and the system updates the product's available stock immediately.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of inventory management - without the ability to add stock, the system cannot track inventory. This represents the most critical operation for starting inventory operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a product with initial stock of 10, submitting an "in" transaction for 5 units, and verifying the product stock increases to 15. Delivers immediate value by allowing basic inventory tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a product "Apple" exists with stock of 50, **When** I create a transaction with type "in" and quantity 20, **Then** the product stock increases to 70 and I receive a success message with updated product details
2. **Given** a product "Banana" exists with stock of 0, **When** I create a transaction with type "in" and quantity 100, **Then** the product stock increases to 100
3. **Given** a transaction with type "in" and quantity 15, **When** the transaction is created successfully, **Then** I receive HTTP 200 with message "Transaction created successfully" and the updated product object showing new stock level

### User Story 2 - Record Outgoing Stock (Priority: P1)

A warehouse manager fulfills an order and needs to decrease the stock count for a product. They submit a transaction recording the quantity shipped. The system validates that sufficient stock exists before allowing the reduction.

**Why this priority**: Equal priority to incoming stock - together these two operations form the complete inventory transaction flow. Cannot have meaningful inventory system without both operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a product with stock of 20, submitting an "out" transaction for 5 units, and verifying the product stock decreases to 15. Delivers value by preventing overselling and maintaining accurate stock counts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a product "Apple" exists with stock of 50, **When** I create a transaction with type "out" and quantity 20, **Then** the product stock decreases to 30 and I receive a success message with updated product details
2. **Given** a product "Banana" exists with stock of 10, **When** I create a transaction with type "out" and quantity 5, **Then** the product stock decreases to 5
3. **Given** a product "Orange" exists with stock of 5, **When** I attempt to create a transaction with type "out" and quantity 10, **Then** the transaction is rejected with HTTP 422 and error message "Insufficient stock for product Orange"
4. **Given** a product "Grape" exists with stock of 0, **When** I attempt to create a transaction with type "out" and quantity 1, **Then** the transaction is rejected with HTTP 422 and error message "Insufficient stock for product Grape"

### User Story 3 - View Transaction History (Priority: P2)

A warehouse manager or inventory auditor needs to review all stock transactions to understand inventory movements over time. They can retrieve a paginated list of all transactions to analyze patterns and verify accuracy.

**Why this priority**: Important for auditing and analysis, but the system can function for basic inventory operations without this read capability. Becomes critical for troubleshooting and compliance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating several products and transactions, then retrieving the transaction list and verifying all transactions are returned in a paginated format. Delivers value by providing visibility into inventory history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 50 transactions exist in the system, **When** I request the transaction list without parameters, **Then** I receive the first page of transactions with pagination information in response headers
2. **Given** multiple transactions exist, **When** I request the transaction list, **Then** the response includes pagination headers indicating total count, current page, and items per page
3. **Given** transactions exist for multiple products, **When** I request all transactions, **Then** each transaction includes product_id, quantity, transaction_type, and timestamp information

---

### User Story 4 - Filter Transactions by Product (Priority: P3)

A warehouse manager needs to review the transaction history for a specific product to understand its stock movement patterns. They can filter the transaction list to show only transactions for a particular product.

**Why this priority**: Useful for product-specific analysis but not critical for core inventory operations. Enhances usability for larger inventories with many products.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating transactions for products A and B, then filtering by product A's ID and verifying only product A's transactions are returned. Delivers value by enabling focused product analysis.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** transactions exist for products A, B, and C, **When** I filter transactions using q[product_id_eq]=A, **Then** I receive only transactions related to product A
2. **Given** product "Apple" has 10 transactions and product "Banana" has 5 transactions, **When** I filter by product "Apple", **Then** I receive exactly 10 transactions, all for product "Apple"

---

### User Story 5 - Sort Transactions by Quantity (Priority: P3)

A warehouse manager wants to identify large stock movements by viewing transactions sorted by quantity. They can sort the transaction list in ascending or descending order based on transaction quantity.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have feature for analysis. The system delivers full value without custom sorting, as users can manually review or export data for sorting.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating transactions with quantities 5, 20, and 10, then sorting by quantity descending and verifying the order is 20, 10, 5. Delivers value by surfacing high-impact transactions quickly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** transactions with quantities 10, 50, 25, 5, **When** I sort using q[s]=quantity desc, **Then** transactions are returned in order: 50, 25, 10, 5
2. **Given** transactions with quantities 10, 50, 25, 5, **When** I sort using q[s]=quantity asc, **Then** transactions are returned in order: 5, 10, 25, 50

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a transaction quantity is zero or negative?
- What happens when a transaction references a non-existent product?
- What happens when multiple transactions attempt to reduce the same product's stock simultaneously (race condition)?
- How does the system handle very large quantity values (integer overflow)?
- What happens when transaction_type is neither "in" nor "out"?
- What happens when filtering or sorting parameters are malformed?
- What happens when requesting a page number that exceeds available data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow creation of transactions with type "in" to increase product stock by the specified quantity
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow creation of transactions with type "out" to decrease product stock by the specified quantity
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that product stock is sufficient before allowing "out" transactions (stock >= quantity)
- **FR-004**: System MUST reject "out" transactions when stock is insufficient, returning HTTP 422 with error message "Insufficient stock for product [ProductName]"
- **FR-005**: System MUST return HTTP 200 on successful transaction creation with message "Transaction created successfully" and updated product object containing id, name, and stock
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist all transaction records with product_id, quantity, transaction_type, and timestamp
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide paginated list of all transactions via GET endpoint
- **FR-008**: System MUST include pagination metadata in response headers (page number, per-page count, total count)
- **FR-009**: System MUST support filtering transactions by product_id using query parameter q[product_id_eq]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support sorting transactions by quantity using query parameter q[s]=quantity with asc/desc direction
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate transaction_type to only accept "in" or "out" values
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate quantity to be a positive integer greater than zero
- **FR-013**: System MUST ensure stock updates and transaction creation are atomic (both succeed or both fail)
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle concurrent transaction requests safely to prevent race conditions on stock updates
- **FR-015**: System MUST return all responses in JSON format only

### Key Entities

- **Product**: Represents an inventory item with a name and current stock level. Products are the target of stock transactions and maintain a real-time count of available units.
- **Transaction**: Represents a single stock movement event. Each transaction records the product affected, quantity moved, direction of movement (in/out), and when it occurred. Transactions are immutable audit records of inventory changes.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully record incoming stock transactions and see updated stock counts within 1 second
- **SC-002**: Users can successfully record outgoing stock transactions with automatic validation preventing negative stock
- **SC-003**: System rejects 100% of invalid "out" transactions that would result in negative stock, with clear error messages
- **SC-004**: Users can retrieve complete transaction history with filtering and sorting in under 2 seconds for datasets up to 10,000 transactions
- **SC-005**: System maintains data consistency with zero stock discrepancies even under concurrent transaction loads of 50 requests per second
- **SC-006**: All transaction operations complete successfully 99.9% of the time under normal operating conditions
- **SC-007**: Users can accurately audit all stock movements through transaction history without missing or duplicate records

## Assumptions

- Products are pre-seeded or created through a separate administrative process (product CRUD is not part of this feature)
- Stock levels are tracked as integer values (whole units, not fractional quantities)
- No authentication or authorization is required for this MVP - all API endpoints are publicly accessible
- All API clients communicate in JSON format
- Standard HTTP pagination practices apply (client can specify page and per_page parameters)
- Transactions are immutable once created (no update or delete operations)
- Default page size for pagination is 20 items per page (configurable)
- System operates in a single currency/unit system (no unit conversion required)
- Product names are unique identifiers for error messages
- Time zone for transaction timestamps follows server time zone (UTC assumed)

## Out of Scope

- User authentication and authorization

- Multi-warehouse or multi-location inventory tracking
- Reserved/allocated stock (stock on hold for pending orders)
- Product variants, SKUs, or batch/lot tracking
- Inventory valuation or cost tracking
- Stock alerts or low-stock notifications
- Transaction approval workflows
- Transaction reversal or correction mechanisms
- Bulk transaction imports
- Export functionality for transaction reports
