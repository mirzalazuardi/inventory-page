# Specification Quality Checklist: Simple Inventory Transaction System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items validated successfully

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**:
- ✅ Specification contains no Rails, Ruby, or framework-specific details
- ✅ All user stories focus on warehouse manager needs and business value
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are explicit
- ✅ Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-003 can be tested by attempting transaction with insufficient stock)
- ✅ All success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentage, throughput)
- ✅ Success criteria focus on user outcomes, not system internals (e.g., "Users can record transactions within 1 second" vs "API response time < 100ms")
- ✅ 5 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios covering all operations
- ✅ 7 edge cases identified covering validation, concurrency, and error scenarios
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 10 key assumptions

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ 15 functional requirements with clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ User scenarios cover incoming stock (P1), outgoing stock (P1), history view (P2), filtering (P3), and sorting (P3)
- ✅ 7 success criteria define measurable business outcomes
- ✅ Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No updates required before proceeding to technical planning
- All user requirements from input description have been captured in functional requirements
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for unspecified details
